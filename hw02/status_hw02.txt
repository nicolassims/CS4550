Please fill in answers to the questions below:


1. What's your name?
    Nicolas Karayakaylar
        
2. What hostname did you deploy to?
    hw02.freudiancreations.website

3. What's the link to your repository on github with your code?
    https://github.com/nicolassims/CS4550/tree/main/hw02

4. How many HTML / CSS tutorial exercises did you do?
    _ALL OF THEM._

5. How comfortable do you feel with HTML and CSS now?
    _I AM A GOD._

6. How many JS tutorial exercises did you do?
    _SEE ABOVE._

7. How comfortable do you feel with JS now?
    Actually, I could probably still do with some practice on these.
    7/10, maybe?

8. Do all of your HTML pages pass the W3C HTML validator?
(https://validator.w3.org/)
    No. I have failed to specify the character encoding, and <head> 
    has no <title>. As I lost no points for doing the same thing in
    the last assignment, I didn't consider it imperative. 
    Nevertheless, I'll remedy those errors on our next assignment.

9. Which parts of this assignment did you have trouble with, if any?
    All those tutorials took 4.57--I timed it--4.57 times the time of 
    the actual assignment. After finishing the tutorials, I had barely
    any time to do the actual assignment. Kinda irritating, especially 
    since we don't get any credit for it.
