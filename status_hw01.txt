5. Which parts of this assignment did you have trouble with, if any?
Well, I asked quite a few questions on Piazza that list what problems
I had, but, if I may restate them here, I found the notes left in the
Professor's GitHub to be a tiny bit vaguer than was necessary. Twice,
due to the aforementioned vagueness, I found I had done something
wrong that took a while to fix. As an example, I had to restart the
VPS, and had to fix DNS issues several times--which took a while, of
course. Although I could do testing through the "hosts" file, I still
couldn't be 100% sure that the project was complete while I was still 
waiting on that.
